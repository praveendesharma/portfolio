# 🧠 Portfolio

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

This repo contains the code for my personal portfolio — a space where I showcase my projects, side quests, and the intersection of data, creativity, and curiosity.

## 🚀 What's Here

- 🎨 A custom-built portfolio site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 📂 Projects that span data science, visualizations, and creative tech
- 🔗 Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and whatever I’m into at the moment

## 💡 Philosophy

I believe in storytelling through data, writing clean code, and keeping things just weird enough to stay interesting.

This site is meant to grow with me — expect updates, reworks, and new rabbit holes as I keep learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks — for now)
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## 🌱 In Progress

Always refining! I'm experimenting with:
- Sensible scrollytelling
- Interactive visualizations
- Blog-like notes section for things I learn along the way
